# Prime Number Spiral

Also known as the **Ulam spiral**, this is a quick one-off to try my hand at a programming challenge I saw the introduction to on YouTube, and I find the pattern generated rather fascinating. It draws a pixel spiral of a number line where all prime numbers are colored black.

The variable `pointScale` may be customized in src/index.ts to change the visualization size.

## To start:

1. Run the following:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

2. View the visualization at the url printed in the console
